Ceylon Type System is Turing Complete
=====================================

<sup>Note: you can find an alternate README in [README.md](/README.md).</sup>

The type system of the [Ceylon programming language](http://ceylon-lang.org) is Turing complete,
which means that it is possible to rewrite any question that a computer can answer (“Is this number a power of two? What do you get if you multiply six by nine?”) as a Ceylon typing problem.
If it’s a yes/no question, you get the answer by checking if the program is well-typed or not (does it compile without errors?);
otherwise you get the answer from an inferred return type (use, for example, “insert inferred type <...>” from your IDE of choice).

“How the hell is that possible?”, you ask? I’ll show you, but first I need to tell you what Turing machines are,
because what we’ll be doing in the second part of this “article” <!-- TODO article? blog post? what? --> is to emulate a Turing machine in the Ceylon type system.
