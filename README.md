Ceylon Type System is Chomsky-3-complete
========================================

This repository contains an example of how to transform a finite state automaton into a series of Ceylon definitions,
and a word into a Ceylon statement, which are then well-typed if, and only if, the automaton accepts the word.

I also plan to write a (more or less) formal proof for this later.
